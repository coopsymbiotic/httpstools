SymbioTIC https/tls helper scripts
==================================

The scripts included in this repository are helper scripts for SSL/TLS
key/csr/certificate generation and validation.

They are by no means exhaustive. Use at your own risks.

Included scripts:

* ./bin/generate-csr.sh: generates a new RSA key and CSR.
* ./bin/validate-crt.sh: validates the certificate from the CA.
* ./bin/test-https.sh: do a few quick tests on the https server. (TODO)
